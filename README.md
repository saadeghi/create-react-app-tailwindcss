# Create React App + Tailwind CSS
## (with Purgecss, Autoprefixer, CSSNano)
It's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but with Tailwind CSS config, ready to use  


1. Clone  
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run start` for live reloading (also reloads everytime you change tailwind config)
4. `npm run build` for production (purges unused CSS and minifes and adds prefixes)

Thanks!
